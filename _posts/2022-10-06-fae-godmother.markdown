*In which our heroine, the Fae Lady Mav takes on an unexpected godchild.*

> [WP] You are an ancient fae being, and as such you know a great many things. What you don't know however is how a mortal couple knows your true name, or why they proclaimed you the 'Fairy Godmother' of their infant child, but you are now contractually obligated to godmother the \*\*\*\* out of this kid.

"Did it work?" the man asked. He looked back down at some notes in his hands, shuffling through the bleached white pages marked in ink. Very unlike the usual skin-and-blood-of-my-enemies sorcerer fare, despite the faint traces the Red Haze's bloodline. It could be one of the others, but she liked blaming the Red Haze for idiocy. These two seemed plenty idiotic, more so than could be reasonably blamed on the sleep deprivation they obviously suffered from. He pushed his glasses up his nose, despite needing no adjustment.

"Doesn't seem like it. It should have appeared right here in the ward," the young woman replied pointing to a dinner plate-sized protection runiform they had drawn in salt on a serving tray. Barely human, that one, but her witchcraft was weak. Her foremothers hadn't drunk demon blood in generations. The woman was checking between a diagram on her big handheld screen while looking at a compass on her little screen which was taped down to the tray. Mav could see the problem immediately: the compass-screen pointed *true* north, not geomagnetic north, so the whole grid was misaligned by a twentieth of a turn. Nor had they made an offering of blood or iron to seal the exchange. Honestly, these *children* weren't even learning their fundamentals. It was disappointing really.

Mav materialized by the bassinet behind the pair, going unnoticed as they were focused on their defective ritual. She took on the woman's appearance in the fullness of health except her eyes violet instead of green and hair long ashen blonde instead of short strawberry. And much more reasonable breasts. The humans' infatuation with secondary sexual characteristics was flatly ridiculous. She wrapped herself in a long, blue, snowflake-patterned robe. Tee shirts and shorts or yoga pants did not present the illusion of powerful magic practitioners regardless of their minuscule talents. There were traditions to these kinds of things, especially first impressions.

They were blatantly ignoring their infant daughter struggling quietly in her bassinet, obviously distraught. Mav picked up the poor thing and cradled her, teleporting the little dear's feces into the yard. A light enchantment dispelled the girl's hunger as well by making her cells' machinery capable of drinking of magic itself when sugar or oxygen deprived--it wouldn't help with minerals or proteins and it was sure to cause problems later, but it would be a teaching moment for an older child.

"*I've got you, little witch,*" she comforted the babe. "*Godmother Mav is going to get you all sorted out,*" she spoke into the child's receptive mind, weaving a little magic on it to work around the girl's defective vocal cords. Mav could see the child's ties of blood to these foolish mortals. The infant's kinesthesia and situational awareness were going to be as impaired as her clumsy mother and her eyes as poor as her nearly blind father, but those were trivial things cleaned up in an instant--Mav almost felt guilty wasting one of the gifts on improving all of them. Another little tweak triggered a latent strength her parents had lost; weak as the infant's magical talents were, she should be able to See the weave, Mav decided.

"*Not-mommy, Pretty hair-feels, \*giggle\**" the girl sent back, the five week old now-telepath already capable of sending concepts. The baby had threaded her fingers into Mav's hair, but its enchanted nature made the wavy locks very resistant to knotting and pulling. Mav had to admit the girl had an adorable spirit. Her parents though... Mav put on her Business Face.

"Now then, what do you assholes want?" Her silky, calm tone was very much at odds with her words. The two mortals jumped in shock and Mav took the opportunity to siphoned off a few years of each's life. She knew implicitly what they summoned her for, but they looked like first timers and their arrogance deserved a little punishment.

"How did you--?" the woman pointed to the runiform then to Mav, confusion and concern written all over her face. The man quietly turned pale, his face falling to horror as he immediately saw who Mav was holding. Priorities. Mav made a wager with herself who had lost more sleep checking on the baby.

"The 'how' is not important. I was never going to fit in your tiny, weak-ass cage to begin with. So take a breath and start over." They both breathed in Mav's aura, binding them to her with a gift of air. The witch struggled against it as she felt the debt settle on her soul. Witches always were more sensitive to soul magics. Mav gave them a satisfied smile, these innocent fools would give up their souls entirely to a well-worded curse.

"Just so we're all sure none of us are misunderstanding, you should repeat your summons," Mav instructed. She rocked the infant gently in an absolutely unthreatening way. Neither mistook her command for a suggestion.

The man coughed, taking a moment to regain his composure before speaking. "I said 'Selikkmavra of the fae court, we call upon you to be our daughter Maribelle's fairy godmother.'"

Damn it, somebody was sharing other people's secrets. His intonation had a precision that only came with practice. He even visualized the black ash falling on a winter meadow as he said her name. She immediately petitioned the Winter Court for a name change, a brief tinkle of laughter coming from her Queen as she approved it. And a small stab of fear from one in the collective. *Got you, you little shit.*

A little bit of predator slipped into Mav's wicked smile at the thought of what tortures she would inflict on the one who had shared her name. "I'm impressed. Your pronunciation is impeccable. You have gotten my name from someone but did they tell you what it meant?"

The mortals shared a glance in a moment of worried silence before the Maribelle's mother shook her head.

Mav turned her back to the parents, returning the infant to her bassinet. The precious little primrose waved her arms up like a winter bloom, wanting to be held once more before pouting on realizing she wouldn't get her way. "It meant 'Eternal Guardian at the Gate of Horrors Beyond.' As you can imagine, I don't normally make house calls. I *liked* that name. I *earned* it. So unless you want to incur my wrath yourselves, naturally you wish me to know the one who shared that name with you."

"It was Makeri, fairy godmother to Emma Jones' child," Maribelle's mother provided without a moment of hesitation, folding like an origami crane. *That little spring glow-bulb didn't give her own name but provided mine?* No matter, the title of Circumstance was enough to uniquely Name the transgressor. She buried her wrath... temporarily.

"Delightful!" Mav exclaimed, clasping her hands below her chin. "I suppose a blessing for Maribelle is in order." Mav summoned an unnecessary sparkling wand, waving it with broad theatrics to spread the glitterdust as wide as possible in their living room. It was going to take a Miracle to get rid of those sparkles. "Neither of my godchild Maribelle Bauer's parents will be lusted or romanced by another while both live," she invoked. Their mild horror upon realization was punishment enough, leaving them thinking that miserable invective was the only gift she'd bestowed upon the infant. And entirely within the Godmother contract, completing the Rule of Five and ending her responsibility for the girl.

"You can't just--" the woman started to object before Mav interrupted her.

"Now that my Fairy Godmother duties here are done, I'm going to go merc that Tinkerbell-looking insect, Makeri, while the two of you discover every meaning of the word precocious." Despite its length, Mav was glad to have read the Godmother Handbook on her way over. Their modern language was so pleasurably expressive. Mav showed them a smile with two pair rows of pointed teeth before vanishing with a snap of her fingers, a room full of glitter the only sign she'd ever been.
