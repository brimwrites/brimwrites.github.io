Dear Diary. Or Journal. idk, whatever you are, magical book thing that I write in. If you have a preference on what I should call you, put it on the next line.

> *Diary is fine.*

I have to admit, your response was a surprise. And your graceful cursive makes my scrawl look like the cramped scribbles of a six year old in comparison, though I'm twice that old now.

Today I wished for an indestructible diary with infinite pages that could never be lost, stolen, taken, or destroyed. I'm not sure the exact wording on the first two requests, but I think the genie took pity on me and fulfilled the intent. My Aunt Jane just asked me what I was doing, and when I told her "Writing in my diary," she gave me a look like she wanted to say something, but turned and walked away. I think maybe she can't see the diary or the pen because it was pretty obvious what I was doing. As for the third wish, the genie told me it had been fulfilled, but he wouldn't say what it was. He did say that I should be exceptionally clear about whether the things I write in my diary are my perception of reality or they are reality itself.

Not being an ancient greek playdoh guy, I can't really tell the difference. Let's say that everything I write in this Diary is my perception of reality unless I note otherwise. How about I add a code phrase for when I mean to indicate that my words should be taken as reality itself? I like "I ASSERT" just like that in all capitals. Like so:

I ASSERT the earth orbits the sun.  
I ASSERT that my Aunt Jane is thirty four years old, even though she insists she is twenty nine and even if she was thirty four, that's a perfectly marriagable age anyway.  
~~I ASSERT that~~  

Let's not get carried away with that nonsense. To be fair, I asked Aunt Jane for suggestions, and she's pretty clever at coming up with things that are easy to remember and spell.

I realized today that I haven't a clue where my mother and father are. I remember them leaving for work this morning, but both of their cars are in the garage, so that can't possibly have happened. Can it? I don't think they call it "early onset dementia" when you start losing your mind at 12. It's Tuesday so it was dad's turn to make dinner, but since it was just Aunt Jane and me, we made some hot dogs and opened a container of potato salad.

There's a girl's room across the hall from mine. The sign on door says Haley's room, but I don't remember a girl living with us. It has the best stuffed animals in there. When I touch the stegosaurus, I distinctly remember the smell of fried food and cotton candy, like we won it at the fair. If her room is anything to go by, we like all the same stuff: hockey, basketball, mystery novels. It's creepy though, there's a wall full of pictures with me, mom, and dad doing stuff like camping, ice skating, or making sand castles, but I'm always standing to one side, like there should be another person in the picture. I mean if I were going to take the picture I'd stand right between mom and dad.

Diary, have I ever met Haley?

> *Yes, you have.*

Diary, where is Haley now?

> *She never existed, but left all her things behind.*

That literally does not make sense. Unless. Diary, am I wishing us into a time loop?

> *Correct, showing requested statistics.*

Diary, why did I wish Haley away?

> *Haley wouldn't let you play with her Pokemon cards.*

Wow, I really am an idiot. Why didn't I just wish for more Pokemon cards?

> Number of times Issac wrote "Why didn't I wish for more pokemon cards?": 503

Diary, how do I get Haley back?

> Showing notes from the end of iteration 118...
