*In which our super anti-hero, Phil, throws a party to threaten his peers with an altered deal. Pray he does not alter it further.*

> [WP] You have super powers. For years now, both the superheroes and supervillains have been bribing you to stay at home and not intervene in any fights. Now, both sides have stopped paying, and you are about to make them remember why they wanted you at home on the couch.

"Who is this? How did you get this number?" an angry woman answered the phone.

"Hi Sandra, it's Phil. I need a favor. Can you send a mind-message-y thing for me?" he asked her. He heard a sharp clatter, which he'd done enough personally to recognize as a cellphone bouncing off the floor a couple times. The call disconnected abruptly. He looked at his phone, a little surprised. Maybe it was a bad time to call?

He reached out for her with his senses. They'd asked him not to do that; reportedly, it was like the finger of death setting off all your fight-or-flight alarms. Oh, she and Rose were in the middle of something, he could tell. The clock on his phone said it was 8:14 am, so it must have been after eleven at night in the Philippines. He frowned. She used to base out of New York City. He was about to put the thing back in his pocket when Sandra called back.

"Hi again. Is this a bad time? I can call back." he answered.

"No, uh, this is fine, Mr. Shadow. I just had some technical difficulties with my phone is all," the woman who now went by Silver Witch assured him hurriedly. "You were saying something about a telepathic message before we were cut off. Who do you need to send it to?"

"Everyone in the plus category and above. You can leave out the latents." Sides didn't really matter to him. It was the rare superpowered who actually followed the law anyway. "Moral" had always been a shades of gray kind of thing. His own code wasn't exactly high ground either, if he really thought about it.

"I can do that, sir," she reported. He hated when people called him sir. The superpowered especially tended to do that. But she continued before he could point that out. "I'm ready now, just speak to me like you're talking to everyone, or leaving a voice mail if you prefer, and I'll make sure everyone gets it."

"Hey yall, it's Shadow. Meeting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Tuesday morning, April 20th, at 8 AM. That's in three weeks, so mark your calendars. Everyone comes or the party's over. No masks or costumes. If there's any fighting or powers, I'll be angry. Tell everyone. Oh, and tell Dominator and Gravelock to stop by my house in the next week or so."

"Is that all you needed, Mr. Shadow?" she asked.

"We've known each other since high school. You remember mathletics or debate team?" he reminded her.

"I remember. We were great at that." There was no nostalgia or much of any emotion at all in her voice. Just detachment.

"No, you were great, I was horrible. Anyway, the point is don't call me Mr. or sir, just Phil, please."

"I'll try to remember that. If that's all, sir, Envy and I have some business to finish."

"Okay, I really appreciate the help. Tell Rose I said hello." He ended the call. She should have said she was busy.

Three weeks passed felt like no time at all. He had been busy with work; his boss was pushing him hard to finish the end of quarter financial reports, and that meant chasing down a hundred loose ends that made the numbers look worse than they actually were. But fortunately, Sofia and Hao had flown in together from Los Angeles as requested and were helping him with the details. Sofia was some sort of lawyer. You wouldn't expect a petite, five foot nothing hispanic lady to have a terrifying presence, but when she talked, others *moved*. And Hao worked for some division acquired by The Mouse; theater or stage design, engineering, and contracting type stuff. When he wasn't building 8 meter tall demon-powered robots that breathed hellfire and shot lasers for illegal robot battles out in the desert. He'd asked for them because of all the American superpowered, they did the least collateral damage with their superpowers. Well, Sofia did serious damage with her *normal* powers, but for his purposes, that didn't count.

Between the two of them, they arranged for everything, from freeing the event site, to hiring local help, to arranging for a stage sound system. From brief snippets of conversation, they'd managed things he hadn't thought of, like making hotel reservations for everyone on short notice, arranging catering, having name badges printed with flags for languages understood, and hiring translators. The unexpected expenses kept adding up, that much he could understand. He was going to have to sell some stocks once the bill came due next month. A lot of stocks.

&nbsp;  
"Thank you all for making time on such short notice," he told his audience. There must at least a thousand superpowered folks out there. Not that he could count with all the stage lighting in his eyes. "We've come a long way from the first hundred, haven't we?" They were so quiet that he could hear the soft sound of one of the caterer's generators in the distance, and the whisper of cooling fans in the stage lighting.

"I'm Phil Umbra."

"Louder!" a man in the crowd yelled. He looked over at Hao, who grabbed a spare mic and held it straight out of his face like a trumpet. Phil had been holding his own mic like an ice cream cone and it had slowly crept down without him noticing. He mimicked Hao before continuing.

"I'm Phil Umbra. You might know me better as Shadow. I work in insurance, where we spread the cost of damage you do over a larger group. That way you can't ruin someone's life completely. For a while now, some of you have been paying me not to get involved. And for fifteen years, I've hated it. But it's been three months since the last of you stopped, so as of yesterday, I consider our original agreement terminated. I have some changes to our agreement, but in case some of the newer folks think I'm incapable of enforcing my demands, I think some demonstrations are in order." He paused, looking for someone in the audience.

"Mrs. Silver Witch, would you pick someone with a flashy power at random and ask them to activate it, please?" He couldn't see her, but he guessed she agreed, because a moment later, he felt the split second surge of someone readying their power, followed by another. He ripped it from them, without even seeing their face and held his free hand aloft, releasing a ten meter gout of flame into the air overhead.

"Is this the power you were going to show, Dragon Strike?" he asked. There were some cries of alarm as people around the man whose power he'd stolen realized he'd started having a seizure. He quickly returned the man's superpower back to his victim, whose real name was Paul. "Asklepios, would you check on Mr. Dragon Strike to make sure he's okay?" He'd probably be fine. God, he better be.

"So you can see I can take your power, without knowing who or why or when." He paused, letting that sink in. The crowd came alive with hushed whispers.

"I can also find you, wherever you are. There's someone who did not answer my call to show up. May I have a clairvoyant come up and assist Mr. Gravelock, please?" He pointed to the AV stand and a spinning star-patterned spotlight moved itself to shine on Hao, who waved. Several people started heading his way. "Thank you for helping, folks. Now, does anyone know a young woman who goes by the super name Kestrel? Her real name is Colette." The crowd murmured, somewhat worriedly, but nobody spoke up. "Nobody at all? Can one of the guild reps send me her phone number." Putting a name or picture to a phone number was an odd power, but a number of the youngest of them had some form of super-google these days, allowing them to stitch together information in an instant, which had impressive utility to a creative mind.

By this point, one of the clairvoyants was sitting next to Hao wearing a high-tech cap, and the video wall on stage behind Phil came to life. On it was a masked young woman with a smile a bit too wide for her face and her long brown hair tied in a chignon^1, netted, and extensively pinned; she hadn't yet given in to the short hairstyles preferred by women with flight superpowers. Her embroidered gray sweater bore a K and an osprey with wings back and talon's outstretched. It wasn't much of a super outfit, but except for the few born wealthy, or with a superpowered parent or relative, everyone had gone through this stage. It appeared to be mid-afternoon and she was enjoying herself a few thousand feet from the ground. And she was *fast*; the ground seemed to whip by her. There was no sound, but the machine seemed to be faithfully reproducing what the clairvoyant was seeing of Ms. Kestrel.

On stage, Phil had his phone plugged into a device routing it to the mixing board, temporarily making it the worlds largest and loudest hands-free system. He tried the number. On screen he watched the woman pull her phone from the back pocket of her distressed jeans, look at the "PRIVATE CALLER" message, and promptly dismiss the incoming call. "I guess she has trouble with spam calls too." he commented to the crowd. "I'm just going to get her attention a little," he warned them. She was somewhere in southern England, he guessed, as he focused on her.

Her expression on screen turned from joy to concern as she looked around searching for danger. There was a collective gasp as the woman began to fall. It was clear she hadn't practiced emergency procedures, but her intuition was good, so she only tumbled a few seconds screaming silently before catching herself. She'd fallen about a thousand feet in ten seconds before Phil stopped suppressing her power. She immediately broke her fall and brought herself to a stop, hovering still two to three thousand feet above ground. The young lady looked frazzled, pausing to catch her breath. This time when Phil called her, she had a disgusted expression and said something inaudible that appeared to instruct Phil to take his sexual activities elsewhere, before sending him to voicemail again.

"That was a bit rude." He had decided what he was going to do about her. "I wish she would land first." He focused his suppression power on Ms. Colette once more, and again her power faltered, this time for only a second or two. He repeated until she was just above the trees, but still she refused to put her feet on the ground. And yet if he tried again, she would surely fall some thirty feet in a horrible crash. He'd send someone for her, and she would be fine, sans powers. He turned toward the audience before addressing them, "You'll recall my message was that everybody with powers comes or I would end super powers. I'm a fair man, and everybody but one came, and I've done reasonable dilligence in trying to reach her, so--"

"Wait! Wait just a minute," an out of breath man in his late thirties yelled from the edge of the stage. A security guard was holding the man by the neck of his black suit jacket, and one arm behind his back. Personally, Phil thought the man's (his real name was Harold) super name, "Cloud Surfer," was a silly, but then, so was "Shadow." Phil smiled reassuringly at him, but it didn't seem to calm him any.

"It's okay, you can let him go," he informed the guard, holding the mic well away from his face.

"If you wait just one minute, I'm sure she'll answer." He was typing quickly on his phone. Phil had never been good with accents, but he had one of those British/Aussie/Kiwi ones.

"So when I asked earlier if anyone knew Ms. Kestrel, why didn't you speak up?" Phil asked.

"I didn't think you could mean *my* Colette," he replied. He looked nervous and concerned.

"You didn't know she could fly," Phil guessed. Harold, the Cloud Surfer, nodded.

Phil almost missed the text come up on the video.

    Daddy> '999 ANSWER YOUR PHONE.'

"Okay, folks, that's the end of the demonstration. We're going to take a five minute break to send someone to fetch Ms. Kestrel from England before I continue with my demands." He signaled for Hao to kill the video and sound, which promptly ended.

This time when he redialed, she picked up immediately. "Hello, this is Shadow," he said.

"I don't really care," the woman's voice came through the monitor in his ear. "I'm having a shit day. I want to talk to my Dad if he's there."

"He's here. But first I wanted to ask you why you didn't come to my meeting."

"Some geriatric supers do in Colorado? Not my thing, you creeper. Besides, I've got school; I can't go forty six hundred miles for a party, even if I had a passport."

"Every superpowered person in the world is here right now, except you. I'm going to give you to your dad now." Phil handed a backup wireless headset to Harold, and told the security guard to go get the World Walker for him.

"Rabbit, it's Dad."

"You're supposed to be at a conference in Frankfurt."

"Let's not tell your Mum about that. If I'd known, you'd be here with me. Darling, why don't you, uh, sit down." With the video blocked, there was no way to tell if she actually had. "Shadow has said that anyone not here for the meeting would lose their powers."

Phil shook his head at the man telling him, "She's just a kid, I'm not going to remove her powers for being ignorant." Apparently his mic wasn't on the call, because she hadn't heard him.

"He can't do that!" she complained. But she had stopped using her powers almost immediately.  "It'd take me at least two hours to get there, and the last time I went that fast, it wrecked my outfit." Phil did a double-take while processing some mental arithmetic. If her numbers were right, that put her somewhere above Mach 3, where the wind should set her skin on fire. She had to have the strength and durability to go with it. The new generation were something else.

"Just wait right where you are and someone will come get you."

With the help of the World Walker, Harold was gone and back again in less than a minute.

"Ms. Colette. I'm Phil. So nice of you to join us."

"You!" She lunged at him. He squashed her power, but she still punched him square in the jaw. "You almost crashed me into the ground!"

"Hmm, you're not afraid of me," Phil replied, avoiding her accusation, rubbing his jaw. He could see how it looked from her perspective. "I didn't crash you. Don't ever touch me again." Her father grabbed her arm and started talking to her quietly, pointing to Phil on occasion.

He got back on stage and readdressed the audience. "Okay, now that everyone is here, it's time to get down to business. My rules are simple.

"Number one, nobody gets killed. I don't care about your guild politics or objectives. Nobody, superpowered or not, should ever be at risk of death. I don't care if it was an accident, unintentional, incompetence, or otherwise, if there's a causal chain initiated by any of you that results in someone's death, be prepared for consequences.

"Number two, no harassment. No disrupting the secret identities of other superpowered people. If your actions have even the tiniest whiff of something I can call psychological warfare, I will put a stop to you.

"I am the final authority on what constitutes a breach of these rules. We have people among us with the power to review the past like streaming a drama show, so don't think you won't get caught. I'll be at the info booth if you have questions. The Silver Witch had something she wanted to say." He handed off the mic.

"Stay just a minute," Sandra asked of him, "I want to call in that favor you owe me."

"Thank you, Mr. Shadow." she said into the microphone. "Scary, right? But I seem to remember we were promised a party!" The crowd cheered and Phil thought he could make out a bass-heavy backing track fading in. "Okay, opt-outs, hands in the air! That means everyone with super intellect--leaking brains spoil the mood." She looked over at Phil and smiled. He knew exactly what she wanted.

In an instant, he power-suppressed the whole crowd save those who opted out. He noticed, unsurprised, that all of the security folks had their hands up.

"Your DJ tonight will be DJ Gravelock. Remember the rules: No powers, No costumes. That means you, new girl! Let's get this party started!" Like Hao had been planning it from the beginning, as soon as her last words faded, the first song broke in, the video wall flashed on, and the stage lights flared into a complex dance. He hadn't noticed the smoke rolling out behind him which must have been building for a minute or two. He'd been all but forgotten by the cheering crowd.

"I don't seem to recall this part of the message, Sandra."

"I changed it a bit. I didn't want them to think of you as a tyrant. Your rules make sense, but nobody is going to like you from your delivery. Besides, there's one thing they desperately need that only you can give them--something they can't get anywhere else."

"What's that?"

"A chance to let loose and get out of control, without worrying about critically injuring someone else, or being feared as different or alien. And for a lot of the physical supers, a chance to get drunk before their super-metabolism takes over. It's a safe space for people like us, and the older supers recognize your long-time impartiality." When she put it that way, he really wanted to be out there with them, but he couldn't do that and keep the peace.

"That's a wild idea, and I definitely feel out-played. What made you think of it?" They paused at the edge of the stage, his path going down to information, hers uphill somewhere.

"You told me to remember high school. Besides, I wouldn't be much of a villainess if I couldn't surprise my arch-nemesis."

"That was a joke, Sandra! From when we were sixteen!" he called after her. She only laughed and waved.
