*In which our band of shabby heroes are invited to a fancy dinner date for which they are unprepared.*

> [WP] "Would you like to donate 1 copper to the Defeat the Dark Lord Fund?" the screen reads as you check out. You tap yes. Those heroes are going to need all the help they can get to defeat you, anyway.

"Of course, I would love to donate a copper for the Defeat the Dark Lord Fund, young lady!" the old man said. "Say, aren't you that famous paladin, Brigitte? Why are you begging in the street for coin?"

"Bandits, sir." She looked terribly embarrassed. "On our way to the capitol the caravan we were guarding was beset by a large group of them out by the Greater Malgos Forest. They took all our equipment.

"Why would they take your armor? Surely they knew no one else could wear it. And the greatsword of Artaric can only be wielded by one of his followers."

"You're very well informed, sir. Unfortunately, the bandits were not so knowledgeable."

"They publish your progress in the papers. Personally, I think your friend Ronwynn writes in with your great deeds. Did you really defeat a dragon with a riddle? That seems preposterous."

"That one is true. We didn't defeat thirty of the Alchemical Cult of Jleth though. That was more of an accident where Augustus didn't know they were storing gunpowder behind the wall."

"Well I won't tell anyone your secret," the old man said, winking conspiratorially. Those filthy old distiller guilds were always failing to store explosives in accordance with regulations. "Where are the others? Ronwynn, Orwath, and Augustus."

"Oh, Ronwynn is, uh." The young woman blushed almost as bright as her hair. "Taking clients at the Temple of Meteria."

"A fine and old profession."

"She's not one of the healers, she's one of the courtesans."

"That's what I was talking about. How do you think the temple can afford to provide free clinic services?" From her expression, it was clear she'd never really thought about that. "What of Orwath and Augustus then?"

"Orwath is at the smithy making commissioned art, he's surprisingly good at it. And Augustus... the wizard is probably getting drunk, leeching off his trust fund like usual."

"Listen, you seem like you're in a tight spot. Why don't I buy you a meal? I'd love to meet you all."

"I don't think that's really..."

"I'll be at The Twin Crabs around six o'clock," the old man said. She looked at him trying to gauge what he was up to. The Twin Crabs was in a well to do neighborhood. Perhaps he was trying to hire them for a job.

The restaurant was on the Politicians Circle, next to a very prestigious inn used by nobles and visiting bureaucrats who didn't rate staying in the palace. The street outside lead straight to the palace and barely showed signs of wear due to meticulous maintenance.

Brigitte had taken the time to bathe and put on a clean shirt, pants, and the boots she'd bought just today to replace her nearly expired pair. If she had a sword, she'd almost feel like herself again, and ready to take on whatever job the old man wanted of them. Until Ronwynn arrived wearing an expensive blue gown and a matching square handbag like she was going to a party at the palace. Then she felt entirely under-dressed for the occasion.

"Where'd you get that?" Brigitte asked her friend.

"Borrowed it from the madam at the temple. It's fantastic, right?" She looked radiant. Even the simple pewter dove necklace she wore gave off an aura of elegance.

At least Orwath was wearing something similarly utilitarian, though he did have a pair of replacement swords at his sides.

"Augustus?" she asked. Orwath shrugged.

"I told him where to meet," the big man said.

"Where was he?"

"You don't want to know," he said, dismissing her question.

"Well, he's late but we shouldn't be, especially if this is a big job."

"I'm not sure about that," Ronwynn said mysteriously as they entered.

The interior was well appointed. Not to the point of garishness, but the witchlight chandelier was sparkling crystal, silks hung to give each table privacy, and the staff were all dressed in uniforms that looked to cost more than she'd ever seen at once. A pretty woman in a black dress maybe ten years her senior stood near the entrance. The place seemed otherwise devoid of patrons.

"May I have your name, please?" she asked Brigitte, for some reason ignoring Ronwynn at her side.

"Brigitte, we were invited," Brigitte told her. She was going to feel extremely awkward if the old man had been yanking her chain.

"Lady Brigitte and company. I was told to expect four. Did you want to wait for Lord Augustus?"

"No, we're late as it is. Augustus keeps his own time, who knows when he will show up." The woman in the black dress smiled discreetly at her joke, as if in perfect understanding.

"This way, please." She brought them to a quiet table in the far corner. The savory smells of the kitchen drifted in the air and Brigitte realized she was famished. The table though, an old oaken thing, well worn and heavily scarred, was incongruous to the rest of the decor, even the chairs at the table had plush velvet cushions. The old man from before wore much the same clothing, a plain shirt and practical pants. Brigitte thought they could be the same ones as before, were it not for the lack of road dust.

"Hannah, could you..?" the man didn't finish his thought only twiddled his fingers in the air slightly, though the woman nodded in understanding. "It's supposed to be a surprise.

"You must be Sir Orwath, I've read so much about you," the old man got up to shake his hand.

"Lady Ronwynn, a pleasure to see you again," he told her, kissing her hand with genteel courtesy.

"And Lady Brigitte, also a pleasure to meet once more." He greeted her in the same way, despite her plainer dress.

"You know him?" Brigitte asked of Ronwynn as they all sat down.

The old man answered for her. "The High Priestess of Meteria is an old friend of mine. I made a point of stopping by after I heard the lady would be there."

She looked at the old man for a moment before appraising Ronwynn, a suggestive eyebrow raised where the man couldn't see. Ronwynn pursed her lips angrily and kicked Brigitte's calf under the table hard. That was going to bruise.

"Sister Safine was very pleased to see you, too. She asked me to remind you of your promise to invite her to visit."

"I wouldn't dare forget." he said, smiling.

"Sorry to be rude, but we don't know your name," Brigitte informed him.

"You can call me Gaius," he told them. "My apologies, I don't meet many new people these days where introductions are necessary."

Before she could puzzle out what he meant by that, she caught a whiff of a god-awful stench, followed shortly thereafter by Augustus, its source, and a black-suited clerk.

"I knew it was you. You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?" Augustus accused their host, in what sounded like an old argument. He broke his tone momentarily to address the clerk. "Hannah, you can drop the disguise unless you're trying to hide from someone else." The clerk's visage shifted back to the woman from before.

"Why do you smell like a stable walked through the front door, Augustus?" the old man asked.

"Oh, I don't know, maybe because there are bandits on the King's Highway. Not ten miles from the city!"

"You've got the finest education money can buy, there is no reason for you to smell like horse shit."

"Oh, and what would I do otherwise? Clerical work? How long would that last before getting sent to the palace or some high level functionary recognizes me and has me escorted there? I'm perfectly happy mucking stables for a living if it means I avoid that."

"And what happened to your grandfather's spellbook?"

Augustus laughed. "I *sold* it."

"*Sold* it!"

"In pieces. Everywhere we traveled I sold a page or three." Augustus sounded particularly proud of that bit of cruelty. "And then I wasted it on alcohol."

"Yes, the Lady Brigitte complained about your behavior already. I can't imagine how you spent a couple thousand crowns on alcohol. It's a wonder you have any liver left." Brigitte's expression had settled into cool disapproval. Augustus didn't look her way, but he pressed his lips together the way he did when she won important points in an argument.

"Ah, about that," Ronwynn spoke up. She looked winsomely contrite. "I'm sorry, Augustus, but it's not scattered across the world." She pulled a folio from her handbag that simply should not have fit were the laws of physics strictly observed. She opened it on the table showing various parts of an aged spellbook with the binding delicately cut, filigreed covers, and gilt leaf edges. "I recovered them discreetly. Not that any of them would report the theft of an illegal, priceless historical artifact. Most of the twelve thousand crowns went to charity." Hannah delicately closed the folio and by some trick of the eye, secreted it into a pocket of her pocketless dress.

Augustus looked at Ronwynn appalled. "I trusted you." Ronwynn resolutely held his gaze. Brigitte took hold of Ronwynn's hand under the table. Her dark haired friend had made no secret that she favored Augustus. If she had done anything, it was surely for his best interest.

"Augustus," Brigitte said. She repeated herself more firmly when he didn't answer. He finally looked her way, but the anger and disappointment didn't follow. "I think it's past time you explain to us what this is about."

"Yes, introductions, wonderful idea. These are my friends. Orwath, one of the finest goldsmiths I've ever met, and handy with swords as well. Ronwynn, gifted in the lute, singing, and acting, but it seems she works for you. And Brigitte, a clever strategist and adroit at political science--"

Gaius looked from Brigitte to Augustus and back. He laughed, finally putting the pieces together. "She's the one who convinced you to, how did you put it? 'See what evils afflict the downtrodden and weak in the shadow of the Dark Lord and right them; going all the way to the top if necessary.'" He looked Brigitte in the eye as he spoke. "She doesn't even like you. And she's such a prude. What awful things would she say about your mother, I wonder. A prideful coward who couldn't face her peers at the Temple of Artaric and turned to begging on the street to avoid their judgement. A poor 'political scientist' with naive expectations of corruptionless governance, who would probably burst into tears if she knew a tenth of the shit I have to deal--"

"Shut your horrid mouth, old man." Augustus was livid now. "You will never speak ill of Brigitte ever again if you want me to talk to you with any degree of civility or respect. Not ever."

Gaius glared at Augustus and looked like he was about to say something, before furrowing his brow and standing up from the table. His assistant brought him his coat, and he walked out without another word.

"Hannah," Augustus called. She paused and looked back. "I'm sorry about this. It's good to see you again." She gave him a thin smile of acknowledgement. She wiggled her fingers his way, magically stripping away the filth and stench, then followed Gaius out.

"What the hell was that?" Orwath asked in an uncharacteristic display of surprise.

"I'm sorry you had to see that. It's been a long time coming," Augustus told his friends. The energy seemed to run out of him and he leaned his head over the back of the chair to look up toward the ceiling. "That was Gaius Temalfah, Emperor of Reythas, and Dark Lord. He's my father."
